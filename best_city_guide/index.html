				<h2>Net Neutrality</h2>
				<p>The Federal Communications Commission in the US is considering abandoning major components of network neutrality. This would legitimize "slow lanes" for network traffic that does not come from commercial partners of network providers. Sites where content is free, and generates no revenue - such as Project Gutenberg - would be at risk for downgraded speeds, access fees imposed by your network provider, or ads embedded by your network provider. Comments are solicited by the FCC at www.fcc.gov. Project Gutenberg encourages you to send messages to the FCC and your lawmakers, to express your views on this important issue.

				<h2>Public domain</h2>
				<img class="feature-img" src="img/nn.png">
				<p>In the US, annual copyright term expiry is set to begin again in 2019, after a 20-year hiatus due to the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998. On January 1, 2019, items published in 1923 will enter the public domain in the US. In the early days of Project Gutenberg, growth of the public domain on January 1 was an annual event. See Duke Law's "Public Domain Day"for a listing of many items that were scheduled to enter the public domain, but have yet to do so because of the 1998 extension. Some notable items scheduled to enter the public domain in 2019 include Felix Salten's "Bambi" and Kahlil Gibran's "The Prophet."
